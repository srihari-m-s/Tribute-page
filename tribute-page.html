    <ul>
      <li>Born on <b>June 9th</b> to Fugaku and Mikoto Uchiha. A prodigy even among the likes of the fabled Uchiha.</li>
      <li>Graduated the Academy at the age of six. Top of his class in all areas, developing interest in the history and workings of the shinobi nations</li>

      <li>Accepted the burden of acting as a double agent to his own Uchiha clan and leaf village. Relayed information on the rising discontent among the uchiha towards the leaf to the village eleders, Danzo and the 3rd Hokage.</li>
      <li>Despite the provocative actions of Danzo in the death of his best friend Shisui Uchiha, Itachi sided with the leaf against the Uchiha who were planning a coup.</li>
      <li>Accepted his final mission for the leaf - to crush the coup from the inside by eradicating the uchiha forces all by himself and accept the sole blame</li>
      <li>On the fateful night Itachi killed all his emotions for the sake of protecting the Leaf's peace as a coup by the elite uchiha would mean a civil war and death of millions of innocents.</li>
      <li>Carried out the genocide of the Uchiha leaving only a sole survivor - his younger brother Sasuke, whom he could just not bring himself to kill</li>
      <li>Part of his final mission was to infiltrate the then rising S class criminal organisation "Akatsuki" and feed intel to Leaf.The 3rd Hokage kept his word to Itachi by looking after the massacre's sole surviovor, Sasuke.</li>
      <li>As a criminal, Itachi inspired hatred in Sasuke in the hopes of helping him achieve the full strengths of the Uchiha</li>
      <li>Sasuke who believed Itachi to be the monster who killed his family and clan single mindedly pursued power to kill his elder brother.</li>
      <li>Itachi chose Uzumake Naruto to entrust Sasuke and his Nindo as he knew his death was coming by his beloved brother.</li>
      <li>In the fatefull battle Itachi not only cleansed sasuke of a parasite(the snake), but also embued his ocular powers to the eyes of Sasuke.</li>
      <li>Ending his life long mission to serve the Leaf and protect Sasuke from the dark history of his clan, Itachi met his fate in front of Sasuke.</li>
      <li>Sasuke would later learn the truth about Itachi's life and follow along his footsteps, protecting the leaf and peace from the shadows.</li>
